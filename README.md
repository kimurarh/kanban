# Kanban

## What is the Kanban method?
Kanban is a workflow management method designed to help you visualize your work and maximize efficiency.

The simplest Kanban board is usually composed of three columns:
* “Requested” 
* “In Progress”
* “Done”

When managed properly, this methord serves as a real-time information repository, highlighting bottlenecks within the system and anything else which might get in the way of smooth working practices.
